Technology version:
	Django 2
	Python 3
	BootStrap 3.x.x
	SQLite 3
	Any virtual environment and pip
	A shell to run commands such as Cygwin

Website template take from: 
	https://github.com/arocks/edge

Details about testing:
	The current version can be found at https://github.com/AlbMej/Syllaview
	The OS all of our team used for this projects was various versions of Windows
	The website was tested primarily on the latest versions of Google Chrome and Firefox
	Over the various versions of our website, out team ran some user testing
		This included surveying individuals on what they thought on the website
			This survey included usability, aesthetics, and more
	We created some manual tests for the website to see if registeration works, but as we
	tried to complete more tasks, the tests broke and we did not have time to rollback so
	we decided against including the tests in the git repository as it would confuse
	future workers as they do not currently work
	To run the website, a laptop with recent specs is needed, as one of our members was not
	able to work on the website on a consistent basis due to their older laptop (i3 processor)

Details on running:
	Details are for windows users:
		Create a virtual environment EX. [python -m venv py34env]
		Make sure your pip is up to date (or dont) and install djano
		create a new project using the template feature of django-admin or pull from git repo
		Go into the project directory and install from requirements.txt
		Migrate and create a superuser for the project using django
		Runserver and see if it all works
	There are instructions for linux on https://django-edge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#quick-start
		but all of the project workers used windows so we can not confirm if it works. 
	
Known issues:
	There is code available for the calendar and the sidebar for the weekly user view. These features work seperately, but in conjunction they do not. We are not sure why, but we believe that it is a common issue with bootstrap and it not behaving well with multiple dynamic objects. 
	We are still trying to figure out a nice way to store the calendar data. A database was the first idea that came to mind, but the scaling of this database for a number of users has made the backend team question if they are building the correct solution. This would lead to partitioning the databases into different pieces, and that's a whole other issues to deal with if it comes to it. Another idea was an XML datatype, but the backend team (1 person), did not have much experience with using and converting data in an XML format.
